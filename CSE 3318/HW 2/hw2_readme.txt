For the answers below assume L1 has size N1 and L2 has size N2.
If you call any of the functions from the provided list.c (e.g. destroy_list), give the time complexity for them.

merge(L1, L2) 
	time: O(     )
	space: O( 1 ), if not, fill in O(   ) and justify: 

check_sorted(L1) 
	time: O(     )
	space: O( 1 ), if not, fill in O(   ) and justify: 

print_list_with_addresses(L1) 
	time: O(     )
	space: O( 1 ), if not, fill in O(   ) and justify:
	
remove_duplicates(L1) 
	time: O(     )
	space: O( 1 ), if not, fill in O(   ) and justify:

destroy_list(L1) 
	time: O(     )
	space: O( 1 ), if not, fill in O(   ) and justify:
